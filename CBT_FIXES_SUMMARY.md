# CBT System Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Score Calculation Not Working on Submit
**Problem**: When students clicked the submit button, scores were not being calculated or stored.

**Root Cause**: The `take_exam` function in `app/student.py` was only saving responses but not calculating or storing the final scores.

**Fix**: 
- Added score calculation logic in the POST handler of `take_exam` function
- Added new fields to `ExamSession` model: `total_questions`, `correct_answers`, `score_percentage`
- Scores are now calculated and stored immediately when exam is submitted

### 2. Report Card PDF Not Showing Results
**Problem**: The downloadable PDF report was incomplete and showed no data.

**Root Cause**: The PDF template (`app/templates/student/report_card_pdf.html`) had empty loops and placeholder content.

**Fix**:
- Completely rewrote the PDF template with proper data display
- Updated the `report_card_pdf` function to pass the same data as the web report
- Added proper styling and formatting for PDF generation

### 3. Reports Not Showing CBT Results
**Problem**: The report card and session reports were not displaying CBT results properly.

**Root Cause**: The report functions were recalculating scores instead of using stored values, and the calculation logic had issues.

**Fix**:
- Updated `report.py` to use stored scores when available
- Added fallback calculation for old sessions without stored scores
- Updated `report_card` function to use stored scores
- Added database migration to add new score fields

## Technical Changes Made

### Database Schema Changes
