# CBT Additional Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Browser Alert "Changes may not be saved"
**Problem**: When students tried to submit their CBT, a browser alert appeared saying "Changes may not be saved" and "Leave site".

**Root Cause**: The browser's `beforeunload` event listener was not being properly removed when the form was submitted, causing the browser to think there were unsaved changes.

**Fix**: 
- Added proper form submission handling to set a flag when form is submitted
- Properly remove the `beforeunload` event listener on form submission
- Added confirmation dialogs before submission to ensure students want to submit

### 2. Question Numbering/Navigation Not Effective
**Problem**: The question navigation system wasn't providing clear visual feedback about progress and answered questions.

**Root Cause**: No visual indicators showing which questions were answered and overall progress.

**Fix**:
- Added a progress bar showing answered questions count
- Added visual question indicators (numbered circles) that change color when answered
- Made question indicators clickable for direct navigation
- Added real-time updates when students select answers
